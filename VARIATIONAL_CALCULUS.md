**Time Estimate:** 1-2 days (or less, if already proficient)

### Topics:
1.  **Lagrangian Formulation of Classical Mechanics:**
    * Generalized coordinates, generalized velocities.
    * Definition of the **Lagrangian** $L(q, \dot{q}, t) = T - V$.
    * **Action Integral:** $S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(q, \dot{q}, t) dt$.
    * **Principle of Least Action (Hamilton's Principle):** $\delta S = 0$.
    * **Euler-Lagrange Equations:** $\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}}\right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} = 0$.
2.  **Hamiltonian Formulation (Brief Review - for context, not primary focus for this guide):**
    * Conjugate momenta $p = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}}$.
    * Hamiltonian $H = p\dot{q} - L$.
    * Hamilton's equations of motion.
3.  **Symmetries and Conservation Laws in Classical Mechanics:**
    * **Noether's Theorem (for particles):** Connection between continuous symmetries and conserved quantities.
        * Time translation $\implies$ Energy conservation.
        * Spatial translation $\implies$ Momentum conservation.
        * Rotation $\implies$ Angular momentum conservation.

**Schwartz Chapters/Sections:** You might need to consult a classical mechanics textbook for a thorough review (e.g., Goldstein, Taylor). Schwartz might briefly touch upon this in the first chapter.

## Phase 2: Classical Field Theory - The Core

**Time Estimate:** 3-5 days

### Topics:
1.  **Introduction to Fields:**
    * What is a field? (Scalar, Vector, Tensor fields).
    * Discrete vs. Continuous systems analogy (from masses on a string to a continuous string, then to fields).
    * Field variables $\phi(x,t)$, $\vec{A}(x,t)$, etc.
2.  **Lagrangian Density ($\mathcal{L}$) and Action for Fields:**
    * **Action** as an integral over spacetime: $S = \int d^4x \, \mathcal{L}(\phi, \partial_\mu \phi, \dots)$.
    * Why $\mathcal{L}$ must be a Lorentz scalar.
    * **Lorentz Invariance:** Review of 4-vectors, Minkowski metric, $\partial_\mu$.
3.  **Euler-Lagrange Equations for Fields:**
    * Derivation from the principle of least action ($\delta S = 0$).
    * **Generalized Euler-Lagrange Equation:** $\partial_\mu \left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial (\partial_\mu \phi)}\right) - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \phi} = 0$.
    * Significance: These are the classical equations of motion for the field.

**Schwartz Chapters/Sections:** Chapter 1: Relativistic Quantum Mechanics (relevant for Lorentz notation), Chapter 2: Classical Field Theory (Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3).

    * Given $\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu \phi)(\partial^\mu \phi) - \frac{1}{2}m^2 \phi^2$.
    * Derive the Euler-Lagrange equation. (You should get the Klein-Gordon equation: $(\Box + m^2)\phi = 0$).
2.  **Complex Scalar Field:**
    * Given $\mathcal{L} = (\partial_\mu \phi^*)(\partial^\mu \phi) - m^2 \phi^* \phi$. Treat $\phi$ and $\phi^*$ as independent fields.
    * Derive the Euler-Lagrange equations for both $\phi$ and $\phi^*$.

    * Given $\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu \phi)(\partial^\mu \phi) - \frac{1}{2}m^2 \phi^2 - \frac{\lambda}{4!} \phi^4$.
    * Derive the equation of motion. How does the interaction term modify it?
4.  **Practice with Lorentz indices:** Express $(\partial_\mu \phi)(\partial^\mu \phi)$ explicitly in terms of $\partial_0 \phi$ and $\nabla \phi$.

## Phase 3: Symmetries and Conservation Laws (Noether's Theorem for Fields)

**Time Estimate:** 3-5 days

### Topics:
1.  **Review of Symmetries:** What constitutes a continuous symmetry of the Lagrangian density?
2.  **Noether's Theorem for Fields:**
    * Derivation of the **conserved current** $j^\mu$.
    * Conservation law: $\partial_\mu j^\mu = 0$.
    * Definition of the **conserved charge** $Q = \int d^3x \, j^0$.
3.  **Applications of Noether's Theorem:**
    * **Spacetime Translations:** Leads to the **Stress-Energy Tensor** ($T^{\mu\nu}$) and conservation of **Energy** ($P^0$) and **Momentum** ($P^i$).
        * Understanding $T^{00}$ (energy density) and $T^{0i}$ (momentum density).
    * **Lorentz Transformations:** Leads to the **Angular Momentum Tensor** ($M^{\mu\nu\rho}$). (More complex, but understand the concept).
    * **Internal (Global) Symmetries:**
        * **U(1) Symmetry:** (e.g., for the complex scalar field, Dirac field) Leads to **Conserved Charge** (e.g., electric charge, particle number). This is *critical* for QED.

**Schwartz Chapters/Sections:** Chapter 2: Classical Field Theory (Sections 2.4, 2.5).
**Peskin & Schroeder:** Chapter 2, Section 2.2.
**Tong:** QFT Lecture Notes, Chapter 1 (Sections 1.4-1.6).

### Exercises:
1.  **Stress-Energy Tensor for Real Scalar Field:**
    * Using the Klein-Gordon Lagrangian $\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu \phi)(\partial^\mu \phi) - \frac{1}{2}m^2 \phi^2$.
    * Derive the stress-energy tensor $T^{\mu\nu}$.
    * Show that $\partial_\mu T^{\mu\nu} = 0$ when the field satisfies its equations of motion.
    * Identify the energy density ($T^{00}$) and momentum density ($T^{0i}$).

    * Using the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L} = (\partial_\mu \phi^*)(\partial^\mu \phi) - m^2 \phi^* \phi$.
    * Show that this Lagrangian is invariant under $\phi \to e^{i\alpha}\phi$ (U(1) global phase transformation).
    * Derive the associated conserved current $j^\mu$.
    * Identify the conserved charge $Q$.
3.  **Maxwell's Equations from Lagrangian:**
    * Given the Maxwell Lagrangian (for source-free electromagnetism): $\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$, where $F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu$.
    * Treat $A_\mu$ as the field. Derive the Euler-Lagrange equations. (You should get Maxwell's equations in vacuum: $\partial_\mu F^{\mu\nu} = 0$).
    * (Bonus: Can you derive the conserved energy-momentum tensor for the EM field from this Lagrangian? It's more involved but a great challenge.)
4.  **Dirac Field (Conceptual):**
    * Understand *why* a Dirac field Lagrangian (which you'll see later) has a U(1) symmetry leading to conservation of electric charge. You don't need to derive it yet, just grasp the concept.

## Phase 4: Setting the Stage for Quantization

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 days

### Topics:
1.  **Canonical Quantization (Conceptual Link):**
    * How classical fields and their conjugate momenta are promoted to operators.
    * Equal-time commutation relations.
    * This is where the classical field theory forms the blueprint for the quantum theory.
2.  **Interacting Field Theories:**
    * How interaction terms in the Lagrangian lead to "forces" or "interactions" between particles in QFT.
    * The role of $\phi^3, \phi^4$ terms, Yukawa coupling, etc.
3.  **Introduction to Gauge Symmetries (briefly):**
    * Why local symmetries are crucial for fundamental interactions (QED, QCD).
    * Local U(1) symmetry for QED (electromagnetism).
    * Non-Abelian gauge theories (QCD). (This is a much larger topic, just be aware of its importance).

**Schwartz Chapters/Sections:** Chapter 3: Canonical Quantization (Sections 3.1-3.3 - focus on the *idea* of promoting fields to operators); Chapter 8: Gauge Invariance (Section 8.1 - conceptual).
**Peskin & Schroeder:** Chapter 2, Section 2.3.

### Exercises:
1.  **Concept Check:** Explain, in your own words, why understanding the classical Lagrangian and action is a necessary prerequisite for understanding QFT.
2.  **Bridge to QFT:** If you have a classical field $\phi(x)$, what does it become in quantum field theory? What are the implications of this promotion?
3.  **Interaction Lagrangian:** How would you add a term to the Klein-Gordon Lagrangian to describe a self-interaction where three $\phi$ particles can interact at a point? What about four? (Don't worry about coefficients for now).

### General Study Tips:

* **Active Learning:** Don't just read. Derive, re-derive, and work through every example.
* **Problem Solving:** The exercises are the most important part. If you get stuck, look at solutions, but then try to re-do it independently.
* **Conceptual Understanding:** Always ask "why?" and "what does this mean physically?" beyond just the mathematical derivation.
* **Draw Diagrams:** For symmetries, visualize the transformations.
* **Consistency:** Always be mindful of indices ($\mu, \nu$), summation conventions, and the Minkowski metric.
* **Take Breaks:** Don't burn out. This is complex material.
